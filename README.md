### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sten Hullebroeck. I am a junior back-end web developer studying at Artevelde University.

Currently I'm in my second year as a programmer.
I have worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Markdown syntax + Nunjucks aswell as React, PHP and TypeScript. Most of my projects so far have worked on express servers with MVC app architecture.
I have also come into contact with other plugins like JwT, TypeORM, nodemon and many more to work on these projects.
In my most recent project I had to work with PixiJS to make an interactive drag and drop sytem as a proof of concept for an online concert planner.

### What do I do?
- Currently I am working as an intern at Esign in Ghent.

You can reach me via any of my social links, preferably on Linkedin for professional or business inquiries.
