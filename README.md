### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sten Hullebroeck. I am a junior back-end web developer studying at Artevelde University.
I'm very passionate about coding and plan to continue my studies in DEA at Howest University in the coming years.

Currently I'm nearing the end of my first academic year as a programmer.
I have work with JS, HTML, CSS and Markdown syntax + Nunjucks. Most of my projects so far have worked on express servers with MVC app architecture.
I have also come into contact with other plugins like JwT, TypeORM, nodemon and many more to work on these projects.

### What do I do?
- Currently I am working on my final projects for the third quarter.
- I'm learning about working with express servers and templating to create static websites and am building the back-end for a mock-up twitch project.
- This summer I plan on learning C++ in preparation for my studies in DAE

You can reach me via any of my social links, preferably on Linkedin for professional or business inquiries.
